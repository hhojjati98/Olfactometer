# Computer Controlled Olfactometer

sketch_jul15a.ino is a sample program file. It contains 120 Trials of which 30 are odd (25%)\
By defult, The stimulus lasts for 2 seconds followed by a 8 second rest period. (No odor) You can change these durations by changing N and Rest variables respectively\
You can also change the number of odd trials by changing the condition of if statement.\
As mentioned in the paper, the olfactometer has a delay of 250 ms. Therefore the trigger signal has to be shifted 250ms in order to obtain more accurate results
